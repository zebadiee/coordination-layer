- Tag: model-layer-adapter-contract-v1
- Commit: 1eca04dda8a517f982dff2a3395c482574de963c
- Date: 2026-01-18
- CI: c7-tests ✅, c8-tests ✅, c9-tests ✅, c10-tests ✅ (see branch `model-layer/c10-adapters`)
- Scope: Adapter descriptor + health schemas, validator, unit tests; no execution, no models.
- Decision: Frozen — any changes require a new C-number and governance sign-off.
