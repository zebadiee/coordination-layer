# Certificate Checklists — Common Jobs

This document maps common job types to the correct certificate(s) and lists mandatory sections and common mistakes to avoid.

---

## 1) Consumer Unit (CU) change — Domestic

- Correct form: **EIC** for the altered circuits; consider **EICR** for whole-installation if periodic or requested.

- Mandatory sections to complete:
  - Description / extent of work (make partial scope explicit)
  - List of affected distribution boards and circuits
  - Schedules of inspection and test results (continuity, insulation, R1+R2, Zs, RCD tests)
  - Signatures for design / construction / inspection where roles differ
  - Comments on existing installation if relevant

- Key tests & checkpoints:
  - Continuity of CPCs for altered circuits
  - Insulation resistance of new/altered circuits
  - Fault loop impedance (Zs) and R1+R2 checks for protective devices
  - RCD operating and trip tests for RCD protected circuits

- Common mistakes:
  - Certifying untouched circuits (always state extent)
  - Missing test schedules for altered circuits
  - Failing to record departures or risk assessments when applicable

## 2) Additional socket (Domestic)

- Correct form: **MEIWC** if genuinely minor and existing circuit origin & protection unchanged; otherwise **EIC**.

- Mandatory sections:
  - Clear description of the alteration and affected circuit
  - Evidence that the existing circuit is suitable (load, routing, existing protective device)
  - Schedule of tests for the altered circuit (continuity, insulation, RCD if present)
  - Signature and date

- Key tests & checkpoints:
  - Continuity of CPC (new work)
  - Insulation resistance
  - Confirm protective device coordination unchanged

- Common mistakes:
  - Using MEIWC for work that effectively creates a new circuit
  - Not verifying existing protective device adequacy

## 3) EV charger installation (Domestic & Small Commercial)

- Correct form: **EIC** for the new dedicated circuit; **EICR** if whole-site periodic check required.

- Mandatory sections:
  - Dedicated circuit design summary (supply, cable size, protective device)
  - Manufacturer installation notes referenced
  - Test schedules and results, including functional charging test where safe
  - Special location notes (outdoor IP rating, earthing/functional class)

- Key tests & checkpoints:
  - Insulation and polarity checks
  - Zs and R1+R2 where applicable
  - RCD and functional tests per manufacturer

- Common mistakes:
  - Ignoring manufacturer commissioning steps
  - Underestimating cable sizing for continuous loads

---

## 4) Periodic inspection of rental (private tenancy) — NI / UK

- Correct form: **EICR** (periodic inspection / condition report)

- Mandatory sections:
  - Scope and limitations (which areas/circuits covered)
  - Previous records referenced
  - Observations coded (C1/C2/C3/FI)
  - Summary and recommended actions with urgency

- Key tests & checkpoints:
  - Continuity, insulation, R1+R2, Zs, RCD tests where applicable
  - Visual inspection for age, damage, and improper DIY

- Common mistakes:
  - Omitting limitation notes where circuits could not be isolated/tested
  - Failing to map observations to duty-holder actions and timescales

---

## 5) Commercial PAT + Fixed Wiring interface

- Correct forms: **EIC** for any fixed wiring alterations (new circuits) and **PAT/in-service** records for portable equipment checks; **EICR** for periodic fixed wiring inspections.

- Mandatory sections:
  - Distinction between fixed wiring works and portable appliance checks
  - Evidence of coordination where PAT indicates issues affecting fixed wiring
  - Signature and scope statements

- Key tests & checkpoints:
  - Fixed wiring: as per EIC/EICR schedules
  - PAT: RCD trip tests where equipment is RCD protected; insulation/earth continuity testing for appliances where relevant

- Common mistakes:
  - Treating PAT pass as proof that fixed wiring is compliant
  - Failing to link PAT failures to fixed wiring follow-up where required

**Usage note:** These checklists are operator doctrines and must be read alongside the IET BS 7671 model forms and GN3 guidance for the exact procedural detail and numerical limits. Always call out jurisdiction and premises type before applying a checklist.
