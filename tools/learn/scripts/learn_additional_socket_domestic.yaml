title: "Additional socket — Domestic (MEIWC vs EIC decision)"
summary: |
  Determine when an additional socket on an existing circuit can be certified via Minor Works (MEIWC) vs requiring an EIC, and extract the exact verification steps required in either case.

sources:
  - source: "GN3 style guidance excerpt"
    content: |
      Assess whether the work adds a new circuit or merely a socket on an existing final circuit. If the circuit origin and protective characteristics remain unchanged, a Minor Works Certificate may be appropriate.

questions:
  - id: Q1
    ask: "Does the additional socket alter the origin/protective device characteristics or create a new final circuit?"
    type: classification
  - id: Q2
    ask: "List the minimum tests required for an MEIWC on a final circuit modified to add a socket (continuity, insulation, functional checks)."
    type: inspection
  - id: Q3
    ask: "What documentation should be provided to the client to show scope and limitations of the MEIWC?"
    type: certification

notes: |
  - Prefer explicit decision rules (MEIWC if no origin change and protective device unaffected).
  - If in doubt, recommend EIC and document the reason.
