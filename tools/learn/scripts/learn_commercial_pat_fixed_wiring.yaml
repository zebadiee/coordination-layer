title: "Commercial PAT and Fixed Wiring interface"
summary: |
  Explore how PAT and in-service inspection results should be integrated with fixed wiring certification and EICR processes in commercial environments, and when PAT failures should trigger fixed wiring investigation.

sources:
  - source: "Commercial maintenance guidance"
    content: |
      Portable appliance testing schedules and fixed wiring periodic inspection should be coordinated. PAT failures that suggest earth leakage or wiring faults must trigger a fixed wiring investigation and possible EICR.

questions:
  - id: Q1
    ask: "Under what conditions should PAT failures escalate to a fixed wiring investigation and potentially an EICR?"
    type: classification
  - id: Q2
    ask: "What practical tests link PAT outcomes to wiring integrity (earth leakage trends, consistent RCD trips, common earth faults)?"
    type: inspection
  - id: Q3
    ask: "How should a maintenance manager be advised about remedial priorities and reporting to duty-holders?"
    type: dutyholder

notes: |
  - Focus on pragmatic escalation triggers (patterns of failure suggesting wiring fault).  
  - Ensure proposals include clear steps to isolate equipment and verify wiring safely.
