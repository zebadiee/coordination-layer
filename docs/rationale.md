Rationale: why a new repo

- The frozen coordination snapshot is an immutable trust anchor (coordination-v1/).
- Introducing semantics (coord-v2) is a new trust domain and must not weaken provenance.
- A separate repository with the imported snapshot ensures hard governance boundaries and clear audit trails.
