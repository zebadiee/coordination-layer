Governance checklist — C6 (before merge)

- Confirm `coordination-v1/` unchanged (explicit check in PR)
- Assign governance reviewer and owner for C6
- Confirm test coverage meets Acceptance Criteria in `C6-CONTRACT-FULL.md`
- Confirm no persistent logs or artifacts of raw payloads in repo or CI artifacts
- Confirm release notes and rationale updated in `docs/rationale.md`
- Confirm tagging policy for any milestone (e.g., `coordination-layer-v1` remains primary trust anchor)
